<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>Wireframes are important tools in the design process, as they provide a visual representation of the structure, layout, and functionality of a website or application. They are typically created in the early stages of the design process. Having a clear plan, pleasing visuals, and simplistic and easy-to-access information.</p>

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<p>User testing is part of the design process for user interfaces . It basically is observing and analyzing how users interact with a website or application, in order to identify usability issues and gather feedback for improving the design. Because of this, things like magazines and design companies frequently use these aspects. </p>

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>
<p>Bootstrap provides a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that can be used to create pleasing and friendly websites quickly . It includes a grid system for laying out content, as well as pre-designed components such as navigation menus, forms, buttons, and typography. It can save time, help in organization, and provide consistency</p>

<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>
<p>Per above, it is more pleasing, consistent and organized. Faster too.</p>
<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>
<p>Adding interactive frontend aspects would rely on bootstrap to do the heavy lifting. </p>
<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>
<p>Selectors are used in HTML and CSS to identify specific elements on a webpage that should be styled with CSS. They allow developers to target certain elements or groups of elements with CSS rules, while leaving other elements untouched.
One example of a selector is the "class" selector. A class is a name assigned to a group of HTML elements, which can then be targeted with CSS rules. </p>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>
Selection: If statements are used to check whether the snake hits the screen boundaries or eats the apple. For example, in the code if (snake.x < 0) {...}, the condition snake.x < 0 is evaluated, and if it's true, the block of code inside the if statement is executed. Otherwise, the block of code inside the else statement is executed.

Iteration: A loop is used to draw each cell of the snake's body. The snake game uses iteration to draw the snake's body and to check for collisions. For example, in the code snake.cells.forEach(function(cell, index) {...}, the forEach method iterates over each cell of the snake's body and executes the function for each cell.

Sequencing: The game loop handles the game's sequence, checking for collisions, updating the snake's position, drawing the apple and snake, and updating the score.For example, in the code snake.x += snake.dx;, the snake's x-coordinate is updated first, and then in the next statement, snake.y += snake.dy;, the y-coordinate is updated.

<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
<p>In the given code for the "Basic Snake HTML Game," ":root" is used to customize the game by defining the global CSS variables that can be used throughout the game. It is used to define the colors of the snake and the apple in the game.</p>
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<<p>The use of HTML provides the structure of the game, defining the layout and content of the page. JavaScript provides the interactivity, allowing the player to control the game and handling the game logic. CSS enhances the presentation and visual design of the game, providing styling and visual effects. Together, these technologies work in harmony to create a complete and engaging gaming experience for the user.</p>
